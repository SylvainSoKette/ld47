# Ludum Dare 47 : Stuck in a loop

[Hello there !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc&t=8) Stay awhile and listen !

Was not feeling well this weekend. In fact I was sick for most of it ! So this is a Jam submission, but technically, it follows all the Compo rules :)

## Stuck in the Hyperloop !

I was just going to SpaceXCon, taking the Hyperloop and all.

And then, like an idiot, I fell out of the train... Don't ask me how I did it.

Fortunately, I'm wearing my fully functional spacesuit replica ! I gotta find a way to survive until they notice I went missing...

They'll come for me. Maybe. I hope.
